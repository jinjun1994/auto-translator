# Tutorial series: learning how to write a 3D soft engine from scratch in C#, TypeScript or JavaScript

[June 13, 2013March 25, 2021](https://www.davrous.com/2013/06/13/tutorial-series-learning-how-to-write-a-3d-soft-engine-from-scratch-in-c-typescript-or-javascript/) [David Rousset](https://www.davrous.com/author/davrous/)[3D Software Engine](https://www.davrous.com/category/3d-software-engine/), [English](https://www.davrous.com/category/english/), [Technical article](https://www.davrous.com/category/technical-article/), [Tutorial](https://www.davrous.com/category/tutorial/) 
  
  
![Gouraud Shading on the Suzanne Blender Mesh ](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/01/10/46/metablogapi/5621.image_thumb_6B370362.png "Tutorial Part 5: Gouraud Shading on the Suzanne Blender Mesh ")I‚Äôd to like to share with you how I‚Äôve learned to build what‚Äôs known as a ‚Äú**3D soft engine**‚Äù through a series of tutorials. ‚ÄúSoftware engine‚Äù means that we **will use only the CPU** to build a 3D engine in an old school way (remember Doom on your 80386 ?). I‚Äôll share with you the **C#, TypeScript and JavaScript** versions of the code. In this list, you should then find your favorite language or at least something near your favorite one. The idea is to help you transposing the following samples & concepts on your favorite platform. You‚Äôll find the Visual Studio 2012 C#/TS/JS solutions to download at the end also.

So why building a 3D soft engine? Well, it‚Äôs simply because it really helps understanding how modern 3D works with our GPUs. Indeed, I‚Äôm currently learning the basics of 3D thanks to internal workshops delivered within Microsoft by the awesome [David Catuhe](https://twitter.com/deltakosh). He‚Äôs been mastering 3D for many years now and matrices operations is hard-coded in his brain. When I was young, I was dreaming to be able to write such engines but I had the feeling it was too complex for me. Finally, you‚Äôll see that this is not ‚Äì that ‚Äì complex. You simply need someone that will help you understanding the underlying principles in a simple way.

Through this series, you will learn how to project some 3D coordinates (X, Y, Z) associated to a point (a vertex) on a 2D screen, how to draw lines between each point, how to fill some triangles, to handle lights, materials and so on. This first tutorial will simply show you how to display 8 points associated to a cube and how to move them in a virtual 3D world.

This tutorial is part of the following series:

If you‚Äôre following the complete series, you will **know how to build your own 3D software engine**!

Your engine will then start by doing some wireframe rendering, then rasterization followed by gouraud shading and lastly by applying textures like demonstrated in this sample: <http://david.blob.core.windows.net/html5/SoftEngineProgression/wireframe/index.html>

It‚Äôs demonstrating the various stage we‚Äôll cover during this series going from wireframe to textures.

By properly following this first tutorial, you‚Äôll learn how to rotate the 8 points of a cube to obtain the following result at the end:

**Disclaimer:** some of you are wondering why I‚Äôm building this 3D software engine rather than using GPU. It‚Äôs really for educational purposes. Of course, if you need to build a game with fluid 3D animations, you will need DirectX or OpenGL/WebGL. But once you will have understood how to build a 3D soft engine, more ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù engine will be simpler to understand. To go further, you definitely should have a look to the [BabylonJS WebGL engine](http://www.babylonjs.com/) built by David Catuhe and I. More details & tutorials here: <https://doc.babylonjs.com>

**Check the MVA video training version**: with David Catuhe, we‚Äôve made a free 8 modules course to let you learn the basics of 3D, WebGL and [Babylon.js](http://www.babylonjs.com/). The first module is containing a 40 min video version of this tutorial series: [Introduction to WebGL 3D with HTML5 and Babylon.js](https://doc.babylonjs.com/how%5Fto/3d%5Fon%5Fthe%5Fweb%5Funderstanding%5Fthe%5Fbasics "http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/training-courses/introduction-to-webgl-3d-with-html5-and-babylon-js")

## Reading prerequisites

I‚Äôve been thinking on how to write these tutorials for a long time now. And I‚Äôve finally decided not to explain each required principle myself. There is a lot of good resources on the web that will explain those important principles better than I. But I‚Äôve then spent quite some time browsing the web for you to choose, according to myself, the best one to read:

‚Äì [World, View and Projection Matrix Unveiled](http://web.archive.org/web/20131222170415/http:/robertokoci.com/world-view-projection-matrix-unveiled/ "http://robertokoci.com/world-view-projection-matrix-unveiled/")  
‚Äì [Tutorial 3 : Matrices](http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/beginners-tutorials/tutorial-3-matrices/ "http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/beginners-tutorials/tutorial-3-matrices/") that will provide you an introduction to matrices, the model, view & projection matrices.  
‚Äì [Cameras on OpenGL ES 2.x ‚Äì The ModelViewProjection Matrix](http://db-in.com/blog/2011/04/cameras-on-opengl-es-2-x/ "http://db-in.com/blog/2011/04/cameras-on-opengl-es-2-x/") : this one is really interesting also as it explains the story starting by how cameras and lenses work.  
‚Äì [Transforms (Direct3D 9)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb206269%28v=vs.85%29.aspx "http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb206269(v=vs.85).aspx")  
‚Äì [A brief introduction to 3D](http://inear.se/talk/a%5Fbrief%5Fintroduction%5Fto%5F3d.pptx): an excellent PowerPoint slides deck ! Read at least up to slide 27\. After that, it‚Äôs too linked to a technology talking to GPU (OpenGL or DirectX).  
‚Äì [OpenGL Transformation](http://www.songho.ca/opengl/gl%5Ftransform.html "http://www.songho.ca/opengl/gl_transform.html")

![gl_transform02 (1)](https://www.davrous.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/gl_transform02-1.png)

Read those articles by not focusing on the technology associated (like OpenGL or DirectX) or on the concept of triangles you may have seen in the figures. We will see that later on.

By reading those articles, you really need to understand that there is a series of transformations done that way:

‚Äì we start by a **3D object centered on itself**  
‚Äì the same object is then **moved into the virtual 3D world** by translation, scaling or rotation operations via matrices  
‚Äì a **camera will look at this 3D object** positioned in the 3D world  
‚Äì the final **projection** of all that will be done into a **2D space** which is your screen

![IC412718](https://www.davrous.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/IC412718.png) ![gl_projectionmatrix01](https://www.davrous.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/gl_projectionmatrix01.png)

All this magic is done by cumulating transformations through matrices operations. **You should really be at least a bit familiar with those concepts before running through these tutorials**. Even if you don‚Äôt understand everything by reading them the first time. You should read them first. You will probably go back to those articles later on while writing your own version of this 3D soft engine. This is completely normal, don‚Äôt worry! üòâ The best way to learn 3D if by experimenting and doing mistakes.

We won‚Äôt neither spend some times on how matrix operations works. The good news is that you don‚Äôt really need to understand matrices. Simply view it as a black box doing the right operations for you. I‚Äôm not a master of matrices but I‚Äôve managed to write a 3D soft engine by myself. So you should also succeed in doing so.

We will then use libraries that will do the job for us: **SharpDX**, a managed wrapper on top of DirectX, for C# developers and **babylon.math.js** written by David Catuhe for JavaScript developers. I‚Äôve rewritten it in TypeScript also.

## Software prerequisites

We will write a WinRT/**XAML Windows Store Apps** in C# and/or a **HTML5 application** with TypeScript/JavaScript. So if you want to use the C# samples as-is, you need to install:

1 ‚Äì Windows 8  
2 ‚Äì Visual Studio 2012 Express for Windows Store Apps. You can download it for free: <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/apps/br211386>

If you choose to use the **TypeScript** samples, you need to install it from: <http://www.typescriptlang.org/#Download> . All samples have been updated and tested successfully with TypeScript 0.9.

You will find the plug-in for Visual Studio 2012 but there are other options available: [Sublime Text, Vi, Emacs: TypeScript enabled!](http://msopentech.com/blog/2012/10/01/sublime-text-vi-emacs-typescript-enabled "http://msopentech.com/blog/2012/10/01/sublime-text-vi-emacs-typescript-enabled") On my side, I‚Äôve learned TypeScript by porting the C# version of my code to TypeScript. If you‚Äôre also interested in learning TypeScript, a first good introduction is this webcast: [Anders Hejlsberg: Introducing TypeScript](http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Anders-Hejlsberg-Introducing-TypeScript "http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Anders-Hejlsberg-Introducing-TypeScript") . Please install also [Web Essentials 2012](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/07d54d12-7133-4e15-becb-6f451ea3bea6 "http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/07d54d12-7133-4e15-becb-6f451ea3bea6") which had a full support for TypeScript preview and compilation.

If you choose **JavaScript**, you just need your favorite IDE and a HTML5 compatible browser. üôÇ

Please create a project named ‚Äú**_SoftEngine_**‚Äù targeting the language you‚Äôd like to use. If it‚Äôs **C#**, add the ‚Äú**SharpDX core assembly**‚Äù by using NuGet on your solution:

[![image](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/01/10/46/metablogapi/1460.image_thumb_315F1AC4.png "image")](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/01/10/46/metablogapi/3108.image%5F13610CD0.png)

If it‚Äôs **TypeScript**, download [**babylon.math.ts**](http://david.blob.core.windows.net/softengine3d/babylon.math.ts). If‚Äô it‚Äôs **JavaScript** download [**babylon.math.js**](http://david.blob.core.windows.net/softengine3d/babylon.math.js). Add a reference to those files in both cases.

## Back buffer & rendering loop

In a 3D engine, we‚Äôre rendering the complete scene during each frame with the hope of keeping an optimal 60 frames per second (FPS) to keep fluid animations. To do our rendering job, we need what we call a back buffer. This could be seen as 2 dimensional array mapping the screen/window size. Every cell of the array is mapped to a pixel on the screen.

In our **XAML** Windows Store Apps, we will use a byte\[\] array that will act as our dynamic **back buffer**. For every frame being rendered in the animation loop (tick), this buffer will be affected to a WriteableBitmap acting as the source of a XAML image control that will be called the **front buffer**. For the rendering loop, we‚Äôre going to ask to the XAML rendering engine to call us for every frame it will generate. The registration is done thanks to this line of code:

CompositionTarget.Rendering += CompositionTarget_Rendering;

In **HTML5**, we‚Äôre going to use of course the **<canvas />** element. The canvas element has already a back buffer data array associated to it. You can access it through the _**getImageData()**_ and _**setImageData()**_ functions. The animation loop will be handled by the _[requestAnimationFrame()](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ie/hh920765%28v=vs.85%29.aspx)_ function. This one is much more efficient that an equivalent of a _setTimeout(function() {\], 1000/60)_ as it‚Äôs handled natively by the browser that will callback our code only when it will be ready to draw.

**Note:** in both cases, you can render the frames in a different resolution that the actual width & height of the final window. For instance, you can have a back buffer of 640√ó480 pixels whereas the final display screen (front buffer) will be in 1920√ó1080\. In XAML and thanks to CSS in HTML5, you will then benefit from ‚Äú_hardware scaling_‚Äù. The rendering engines of XAML and of the browser will stretch the back buffer data to the front buffer window by even using an anti-aliasing algorithm. In both cases, this task is done by the GPU. This is why we call it ‚Äúhardware scaling‚Äù (hardware is the GPU). You can read more about this topic addressed in HTML5 here: [Unleash the power of HTML 5 Canvas for gaming](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/eternalcoding/archive/2012/03/22/unleash-the-power-of-html-5-canvas-for-gaming-part-1.aspx?Redirected=true "http://blogs.msdn.com/b/eternalcoding/archive/2012/03/22/unleash-the-power-of-html-5-canvas-for-gaming-part-1.aspx?Redirected=true") . This approach is often used in games for instance to boost the performance as you have less pixels to address.

## Camera & Mesh objects

Let‚Äôs start coding. First, we need to define some objects that will embed the details needed for a camera and for a mesh. A mesh is a cool name to describe a 3D object.

Our _Camera_ will have 2 properties: its position in the 3D world and where it‚Äôs looking at, the target. Both are made of 3D coordinates named a Vector3\. C# will use **SharpDX.Vector3** and TypeScript & JavaScript will use **BABYLON.Vector3**.

Our _Mesh_ will have a collection of vertices (several vertex or 3D points) that will be used to build our 3D object, its position in the 3D world and its rotation state. To identify it, it will also have a name.

To resume, we need the following code:

* [C#](#one)
* [TypeScript](#two)
* [JavaScript](#three)

// Camera.cs & Mesh.cs
using SharpDX;

namespace SoftEngine
{
    public class Camera
    {
        public Vector3 Position { get; set; }
        public Vector3 Target { get; set; }
    }
    public class Mesh
    {
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public Vector3[] Vertices { get; private set; }
        public Vector3 Position { get; set; }
        public Vector3 Rotation { get; set; }

        public Mesh(string name, int verticesCount)
        {
            Vertices = new Vector3[verticesCount];
            Name = name;
        }
    }
}

//<reference path="babylon.math.ts"/>
module SoftEngine {
    export class Camera {
        Position: BABYLON.Vector3;
        Target: BABYLON.Vector3;

        constructor() {
            this.Position = BABYLON.Vector3.Zero();
            this.Target = BABYLON.Vector3.Zero();
        }
    }
    export class Mesh {
        Position: BABYLON.Vector3;
        Rotation: BABYLON.Vector3;
        Vertices: BABYLON.Vector3[];

        constructor(public name: string, verticesCount: number) {
            this.Vertices = new Array(verticesCount);
            this.Rotation = BABYLON.Vector3.Zero();
            this.Position = BABYLON.Vector3.Zero();
        }
    }
}

var SoftEngine;
(function (SoftEngine) {
    var Camera = (function () {
        function Camera() {
            this.Position = BABYLON.Vector3.Zero();
            this.Target = BABYLON.Vector3.Zero();
        }
        return Camera;
    })();
    SoftEngine.Camera = Camera;    
    var Mesh = (function () {
        function Mesh(name, verticesCount) {
            this.name = name;
            this.Vertices = new Array(verticesCount);
            this.Rotation = BABYLON.Vector3.Zero();
            this.Position = BABYLON.Vector3.Zero();
        }
        return Mesh;
    })();
    SoftEngine.Mesh = Mesh;    
})(SoftEngine || (SoftEngine = {}));

For instance, if you want to describe a cube using our Mesh object, you need to create 8 vertices associated to the 8 points of the cube. Here are the coordinates on a cube displayed in Blender:

[![image](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/01/10/46/metablogapi/5140.image_thumb_2BF2AA73.png "image")](https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/01/10/46/metablogapi/4540.image%5F2D374352.png)

With a left-handed world. Remember also that when you‚Äôre creating a mesh, the coordinates system is starting at the center of the mesh. So, X=0, Y=0, Z=0 is the center of the cube.

This could be created via this kind of code:

var mesh = new Mesh("Cube", 8);
mesh.Vertices[0] = new Vector3(-1, 1, 1);
mesh.Vertices[1] = new Vector3(1, 1, 1);
mesh.Vertices[2] = new Vector3(-1, -1, 1);
mesh.Vertices[3] = new Vector3(-1, -1, -1);
mesh.Vertices[4] = new Vector3(-1, 1, -1);
mesh.Vertices[5] = new Vector3(1, 1, -1);
mesh.Vertices[6] = new Vector3(1, -1, 1);
mesh.Vertices[7] = new Vector3(1, -1, -1);

## The most important part: the Device object

Now that we have our basic objects and we know how to build 3D meshes, we need the most important part: the **Device object. It‚Äôs the core of our 3D engine**.

In it‚Äôs rendering function, we will build the view matrix and the projection matrix based on the camera we will have defined before.

Then, we will iterate through each available mesh to build their associated world matrix based on their current rotation and translation values. Finally, once done, the final transformation matrix to apply is:

var transformMatrix = worldMatrix * viewMatrix * projectionMatrix;

This is the concept you absolutely need to understand by reading the previous prerequisites resources. Otherwise, you will probably simply copy/paste the code without understanding anything about the magic underneath. This is not a very big problem for further tutorials but again, it‚Äôs better to know what‚Äôs you‚Äôre coding.

Using this transformation matrix, we‚Äôre going to project each vertex of each mesh in the 2D world to obtain X,Y coordinates from their X,Y,Z coordinates. To finally draw on screen, we‚Äôre adding a small clip logic to only display visible pixels via a PutPixel method/function.

Here are the various versions of the Device object. I‚Äôve tried to comment the code to help you understanding it as much as possible.

**Note:** Microsoft Windows is drawing using the BGRA color space (Blue, Green, Red, Alpha) whereas the HTML5 canvas is drawing using the [RGBA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGBA%5Fcolor%5Fspace) (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) color space. That‚Äôs why, you will notice some slight differences in the code between C# and HTML5.

* [C#](#devicecsharp)
* [TypeScript](#devicetypescript)
* [JavaScript](#devicejavascript)

using Windows.UI.Xaml.Media.Imaging;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices.WindowsRuntime;
using SharpDX;

namespace SoftEngine
{
    public class Device
    {
        private byte[] backBuffer;
        private WriteableBitmap bmp;

        public Device(WriteableBitmap bmp)
        {
            this.bmp = bmp;
            // the back buffer size is equal to the number of pixels to draw
            // on screen (width*height) * 4 (R,G,B & Alpha values). 
            backBuffer = new byte[bmp.PixelWidth * bmp.PixelHeight * 4];
        }

        // This method is called to clear the back buffer with a specific color
        public void Clear(byte r, byte g, byte b, byte a) {
            for (var index = 0; index < backBuffer.Length; index += 4)
            {
                // BGRA is used by Windows instead by RGBA in HTML5
                backBuffer[index] = b;
                backBuffer[index + 1] = g;
                backBuffer[index + 2] = r;
                backBuffer[index + 3] = a;
            }
        }

        // Once everything is ready, we can flush the back buffer
        // into the front buffer. 
        public void Present()
        {
            using (var stream = bmp.PixelBuffer.AsStream())
            {
                // writing our byte[] back buffer into our WriteableBitmap stream
                stream.Write(backBuffer, 0, backBuffer.Length);
            }
            // request a redraw of the entire bitmap
            bmp.Invalidate();
        }

        // Called to put a pixel on screen at a specific X,Y coordinates
        public void PutPixel(int x, int y, Color4 color)
        {
            // As we have a 1-D Array for our back buffer
            // we need to know the equivalent cell in 1-D based
            // on the 2D coordinates on screen
            var index = (x + y * bmp.PixelWidth) * 4;

            backBuffer[index] = (byte)(color.Blue * 255);
            backBuffer[index + 1] = (byte)(color.Green * 255);
            backBuffer[index + 2] = (byte)(color.Red * 255);
            backBuffer[index + 3] = (byte)(color.Alpha * 255);
        }

        // Project takes some 3D coordinates and transform them
        // in 2D coordinates using the transformation matrix
        public Vector2 Project(Vector3 coord, Matrix transMat)
        {
            // transforming the coordinates
            var point = Vector3.TransformCoordinate(coord, transMat);
            // The transformed coordinates will be based on coordinate system
            // starting on the center of the screen. But drawing on screen normally starts
            // from top left. We then need to transform them again to have x:0, y:0 on top left.
            var x = point.X * bmp.PixelWidth + bmp.PixelWidth / 2.0f;
            var y = -point.Y * bmp.PixelHeight + bmp.PixelHeight / 2.0f;
            return (new Vector2(x, y));
        }

        // DrawPoint calls PutPixel but does the clipping operation before

## Putting it all together

We finally need to create a mesh (our cube), create a camera and target our mesh & instantiate our Device object.

Once done, we will launch the animation/rendering loop. In optimal cases, this loop will be called every 16ms (60 FPS). During each tick (call to the handler registered to the rendering loop), we will launch the following logic every time:

1 ‚Äì **Clear the screen** and all associated pixels with black ones (_Clear()_ function)

2 ‚Äì **Update the various position & rotation values** of our meshes

3 ‚Äì **Render them** into the back buffer by doing the required matrix operations (_Render()_ function)

4 ‚Äì **Display them** on screen by flushing the back buffer data into the front buffer (_Present()_ function)

Hi !  
Thanks for this great introduction on how to make a soft 3D engine ! It's really easy to read, I think it's good to offer these three languages ‚Äã‚Äãbecause it allows us to see several methods. Another big thanks, I can't wait for the next =)

         For the TypeScript code didn‚Äôt show up properly on the comments. So, I will try again:  
          window.requestAnimationFrame = (function(){  
          return window.requestAnimationFrame ||  
          (<any> window).webkitRequestAnimationFrame ||  
          (<any> window).mozRequestAnimationFrame ||  
          (<any> window).oRequestAnimationFrame ||  
          (<any> window).msRequestAnimationFrame ||  
          function(/\* function \*/ callback, /\* DOMElement \*/ element){  
          window.setTimeout(callback, 1000 / 60);  
          };

for JS :  
It should be added at the beginning of this script main.js file (for three examples):  
// shim layer with setTimeout fallback  
window.requestAnimationFrame = (function () {

 window.webkitRequestAnimationFrame ||

Le probl√®me ne vient pas de ton site "[david.blob.core.windows.net/softengine3d"](http://david.blob.core.windows.net/softengine3d") qui fonctionne (test√© sur Maxthon 3, IE9, chrome 27, FirexFox 15.0.1, 16.0.2 et 21.0) mais de tes zip pour javascript.  
Pour preuve, il parle d'un probl√®me avec la fonction "requestAnimationFrame" (requestAnimationFrame(drawingLoop);) alors que celle que tu utilises sur ton site s'appelle "requestAnimFrame" (c'est gr√¢ce √† IE que j'ai pu r√©cup√©rer justement le script manquant dans le main.js en faisant une comparaison de code).

Really good work David. I really like your approach ‚Äì writing engine from scratch even with front end part where You put pixels on screen.  
I'm wondering ‚Äì if it's possible to write it in C# in VS2010 under win 7? Without using XAML and whole "web environment" ?  
SharpDX is useful for vectors and matrix operations ‚Äì but how do I "link" it with my project under VS 2010? Also what should I use rather than XAML image control?  
I would be really grateful for some advices üòâ  
Take care

Hi Lucas. Thanks for your feedback! Yes, you can. I know some people who has already port the tutorials in C#/Winform, in Java and even Under Windows CE.  
You can download the SharpDX version working with Win7 desktop project: <http://sharpdx.org/>

Super !  
J'ai enfin fini les pr√©requis et donc cette premi√®re partie. J'ai ador√©. Par contre, je suis frustr√© car je n'ai toujours pas compris, au sens math√©matique, pourquoi pour construire la matrice de projection il faut diviser les composantes x et y des points par leur composante z. Mais bon, on peut vivre sans avoir compris √ßa et au pire je le reprendrai plus tard.  
Encore merci et vivement la suite üôÇ  
@Lucas : I'm also on a Win7 environement, and I made a WPF project so David's code is 99% compatible. The only difference is that WriteableBimap has no "PixelBuffer" property. The workaround is the WritePixels() method.  
So my Present() method contains only the following code :  
\_bitmap.WritePixels(new System.Windows.Int32Rect(0, 0, \_bitmap.PixelWidth, \_bitmap.PixelHeight), \_backBuffer, \_bitmap.PixelWidth \* 4, 0);  
The other difference is in the init of the WritableBitmap :  
var bmp = new WriteableBitmap(640, 480, 96, 96, PixelFormats.Bgra32, null);  
96 is the "dpi" for x and y, I've found the value somewhere on the web and I guess it's the default dpi for a screen but I don't know if it's supposed to vary depending on the screen. Anyway the code works great !

         For anyone else that is currently wondering about this. This is how I did it in WPF:  
         public void Present(Image image)  
          {  
          bmp.WritePixels(new System.Windows.Int32Rect(0, 0, bmp.PixelWidth, bmp.PixelHeight), backBuffer, bmp.PixelWidth \* 4, 0);  
          image.Source = bmp;  
          }  
         I have an Image on the main page that I pass to this method. bmp is still a WriteableBitmap. My image is 1920√ó1080 and it writes in less than a millisecond with my setup.

Oops, sorry Lucas but I didn't see you answered something until now. So if you come by here again, here is my answer : I was at 60fps with the cube on an Intel G870 CPU (my workstation), and still almost at 60fps with the textured monkey of the last tuto.  
I tried to access directly the WriteableBitmap's backbuffer like David, using unsafe code like in this link : [stackoverflow.com/‚Ä¶/how-to-edit-a-writablebitmap-backbuffer-in-non-ui-thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9868929/how-to-edit-a-writablebitmap-backbuffer-in-non-ui-thread)  
I was like "Wow ! I'm using unsafe code ! I'm a reel demomaker, it's gonna be √ºber fast !!". XD  
And, big surprise, it was awfully slow.  
So to my experience, WritePixels() is way more efficient than direct memory access to the backbuffer, but maybe it exists another method I haven't heard about.

My problem is in the device.prototype.project() in the javascript solution in the following lines,  
 var x = point.x \* this.workingWidth + this.workingWidth / 2.0 >> 0;  
 var y = -point.y \* this.workingHeight + this.workingHeight / 2.0 >> 0;  
I don't understand the multiplication with workingHeight and width. This may be pretty trivial, but i am stuck üôÅ any help would be much appreciated üôÇ

Great, simply great !  
I've been trying to add another camera, without success, if anyone wants to give it a try.  
I'm actively working on those tutorials, and would like to extend them into another blog/discussion for a deeper approach/explanation if I'm allowed to.  
Anyway very good job. (See you at the tech days.)

@Saad : take a look at the two first graphics of the "Reading Prerequisites" chapter.  
After all transformations and cliping, and just before the transformation to "window space", all coordinates are "normalized", which means they are between -1 and 1\.  
So the code you pasted makes sure the final coordinates are between 0 and respectively layer's width and height.

Petite question, est-il possible de d√©velopper une application 3D autre qu'un jeu avec ce moteur. J'ai eu utiliser SilverlightXNA qui permettait de faire des interfaces avec tout les contr√¥les habituels et de plsu y ajouter la 3D.  
Qu'en est-il aujourd'hui ?  
Merci

Bonjour Yannick,  
 Bah comme tout moteur 3d, il n'y a rien de sp√©cifique au jeu dans ce moteur. Vous pouvez tout √† fait l'utiliser sur autre chose que du jeu pour mod√©liser des graphiques ou toutes autres choses "plus s√©rieuses" üôÇ  
 Qu'imaginez-vous r√©aliser?  
Bye,  
David

Hi! Thanks for a great tutorial. Made a lot of sense!  
When I implemented the code everything works perfectly except that the x-axis is mixed up. If I plot two pixels A=\[0,0,0\] and B\[1,0,0\] I would expect B to be to the right of A, but it draws to the left of it. Is this expected or have I missed something?  
I implemented this with Javascript  
Thanks!

Hi David,  
Firstly, many thanks for this excellent series of posts! Unfortunately, I've fallen at the first hurdle and hope you might be able to help me up :). I had assumed that the call to TransformCoordinate() in Project() would return normalised X/Y co-ordinates in the range \[-1,1\], however the range is actually \[-0.5, 0.5\]! I've looked at the SharpDX code that builds the projection matrix and to my untrained eyes it looks like it should generate X & Y coordinates in the range \[-1,1\] after the perspective divide ‚Äì but it doesn't! Do you know why this isn't the case? Also what's the range of the z-value?  
Thank you!

This is just to clarify my eariler post. There are two things I'm not quite getting about the mapping to screen space:  
1) I thought that the clip/perspective matrix generated by the call below would map camera space z-values to -1 at the near clip plane and 1 at the far clip plane; however I've found that changing the far clip plane parameter (e.g. to 100) has no effect on the transformed point. Can you tell me why this is?  
var projectionMatrix = Matrix.PerspectiveFovRH(0.78f,  
 (float)bmp.PixelWidth / bmp.PixelHeight,  
 0.01f, 1.0f);  
2) I was also under the impression that the same matrix would map x and y screen space values to the range \[-1, 1\] (-1 at left and bottom clip planes, 1 at top and bottom), but unless I'm mistaken the code below assumes values in the range \[-0.5, 0.5\]:  
var x = point.X \* bmp.PixelWidth + bmp.PixelWidth / 2.0f;  
var y = -point.Y \* bmp.PixelHeight + bmp.PixelHeight / 2.0f;  
I really want to understand this stuff in order to move onto the next tutorial in the series, therefore please can you let me know why the expectations above proved wrong?  
Many thanks,  
James

It's the best computer graphic (polygonal modeling) guide I've ever found and it have examples exactly in the languages that I using to learn it. But there are some points disturbing me. First of all it is using additional libraries like Babylon. During learning I would like to reinvent all possible wheels including matrix operations and JSON parsing. Also WinRT is good, but while I know only WinForms I prefer going through the WPF for beginning. And why do you use such insane nested way to create object in JS? Has it any advantages before defining constructor-like function and using "new" statement?

Everything works fine until I let the camera fly through a meshe's origin. Then everything is displayed mirrored but it shouldn't be visible. Is there a way to fix that?

Given the formulat:  
var x = point.X \* bmp.PixelWidth + bmp.PixelWidth / 2.0f;  
var y = -point.Y \* bmp.PixelHeight + bmp.PixelHeight / 2.0f;  
The point \[1, 0\] will be mapped to \[1.5\*bmp.PixelWidth, bmp.PixelHeight / 2.0f\], so the point will not be draw?

 Hi.  
Thanks David for the tut ! It really makes things simple to understand.  
For this particular one, I've used notepad++ and Javascript.  
the 8 points animate well in google, firefox; However in ie11, i get the canvas without animation.  
I'm still checking out what went wrong‚Ä¶Any suggestion ?

Very nice, although I would really like it if this was a bit more language agnostic. I'd rather build everything from the ground up than use libraries.

Hi.  
I created a Windows Store App, writing in C# in Visual Studio Pro 2013 Update4 on Windows8.1\. Pro.  
Starting the run, I receive error messages: "frontBuffer" (in the Page\_Loaded section) is an unknown name to the project SoftEngine.Windows as is the component "Sharp.DX.D3DCompiler" which is referred to. I think, all references shown in the tutorial are added in my solution.  
In the object catalogue I could not find the references for eliminating the error messages.  
Can anyone help to fix this?  
Thanks in advance.

 var projectionMatrix = Matrix.PerspectiveFovRH(0.78f, (float)bmp.PixelWidth / bmp.PixelHeight, 0.01f, 1.0f);  
The first one is using left-hand coordinate system method and the second one is using right-hand, is it mistake?

public void Present()  
 I am trying to run this code in C# WPF I am stuck here‚Äô. It doesn‚Äôt seem to like ‚ÄúPixelBuffer‚Äù or ‚ÄúInvalidate‚Äù I know it has to do with WritableBitmap in WPF  
Any ideas ? By the way awesome tutorial.  
 {  
 using (var stream = bmp.PixelBuffer.AsStream())  
 {  
 // writing our byte\[\] back buffer into our WriteableBitmap stream  
 stream.Write(backBuffer, 0, backBuffer.Length);  
 }  
 // request a redraw of the entire bitmap  
 bmp.Invalidate();  
 }

I asked the question about this code and WPF. After more reading and some head banging I got it to work. Now Im ready to move on.  
Thanks.

Hi, i skipped over your code and i found a few things confusing. First, your Model\_View\_Projection(MVP) matrix is calculated in the opposite order i am used to. I don‚Äôt really know how the library you‚Äôre using works but this seems a little bit confusing. As a follow up the project() function is even more confusing and i think its mainly due to what  
var point = Vector3.TransformCoordinate(coord, transMat);  
is really doing and maybe this is connected with the confusion of the construction or your MVP matrix. At this point i would expect that this line transforms from object space -> camera space -> normalized screen space in the range from \[-1,1\]. You would then do the perspective divide and the transformation to raster space \[0, screen\_width\] ‚Ä¶ but nothing of this happens in your code. No perspective divide and a confusing mapping that suggests that point (the result of the confusing TransformCoordinate function) is within the range of \[-0.5, 0.5\]. I‚Äôve never seen this before and i think its due to how Babylon works (never used it). Maybe you should clarify on that point because this seems to be very special in how Babylon works and is just very confusing if one would implement your code without Babylon maybe in another language.  
best regards, Matt

Hi Davrous, I am coding this in vb.net and have just installed SharpDX using NuGet onto Visual Studio 2015\. My program is perfectly happy importing SharpDX, however when I try use Vector3 it does not recognise this‚Ä¶ any suggestions? There seems to be no Vector3 on there?

                              Thank you for your response. I initially used NuGet to download SharpDX. I attempted to use Mathematics extension from that and did not realize I had to also download the NuGet SharpDX.Mathematics first.

         Hi, I‚Äôve implemented your project with a back buffer of 640\*480\. But I found that the cube would be stretched into a cuboid. It is weird so I really wonder how to solve this problem.

Came across your tutorials about two thirds of the way through a very similar project but using vb.net (winforms). Though I took some different approaches e.g. I used Bresenham‚Äôs line drawing algorithm for example. It was still very informative. Especially your description of the Z-buffer.  
So thank you.

Hi David, your tutorial is an absolute treasure.  
I am trying to do the exact same thing as you, I mean, to learn 3D from bare C# using maths and Winforms GDI+. Except my work was based on the excellent site of Song Ho (<http://www.songho.ca/opengl/index.html>) and his nice C++ projects.  
I managed to reach a high level of satisfaction seeing anithing running so smooth‚Ä¶ Except for the rasterization part when trying to deal with lights. Suddenly, GDI polygons show their limits whenyou must modify inside.  
The rasterisation part you explain is exactly what I was looking for, and drawing a line by myself directly in a byte\[\] buffer was something I did not even dare üôÇ  
I cannot wait to try this backbuffer technique and implement direct byte\[\] drawing for triangles. Then, using TPL and peppering AggressiveInlines where it needs to.  
I cannot thank you enough for sharing your work !
